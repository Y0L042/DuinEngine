# Duin Engine

A small, simple C++ game engine. The goal is to have a small, simple game engine that makes it nice and simple for coders and hobbyists to make small games.

I wanted an engine, without all the UI, tooling, and extra features that most engines have. While those features can be extremely useful, as someone who likes a code-first approach, most of those features went unused.
